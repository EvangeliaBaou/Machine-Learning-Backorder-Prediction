# Project: Backorder Prediction using Machine Learning Classifiers
This project concerns a binary classification problem. Particularly, a backorder is the order which could not be fulfilled by the company. Due to high demand of a product, the company was not able to keep up with the delivery of the order. The backordering can lead to upsetting customer as they couldn't get what they ordered and the loyalty will decrease.
Also, company cannot overstock every product in their inventory to avoid such situation.
There has to be a way for the company to know for which products they can face this problem.
So, the company has shared a data file with different input features for each product and it hopes to find a pattern inside this data which can give them some insight.
The data file contains the historical data for some weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict.
The data has 23 columns including 22 features and one target column.
The dataset used can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mh554ii745vmu8y/backorder%20prediction.csv?dl=0
The code implemented in Python 3.6.9 and the following libraries are used: sklearn,numpy,pandas,imblearn,matplotlib
